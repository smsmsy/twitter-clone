(For JAPANESE: [README-JP.md](README-JP.md))

I decided to study by building a Twitter (X) clone application.

### Sliding Drawer Menu

## Getting Started

This project uses FVM.

Using FVM is recommended, but you can also work with the native SDK by updating the `environment` section in [pubspec.yaml](pubspec.yaml).

```yaml
environment:
  sdk: ^3.9.2 # Align this version with your Dart SDK version
```

After that, run `flutter run`.
